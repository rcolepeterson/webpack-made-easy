2. $ cd webpack-tut
3. Create a index.js file and a index.html file in your root directory.
4. Add <script src="bundle.js"></script> to index.js (bundle.js will be generated later).
5. Add console.log("hello") in the index.js
6. $ webpack index.js bundle.js
7. You should now see a bundle.js file in your root directory.

};
module.exports = config;
